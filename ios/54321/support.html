    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Q: What is the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>A:</strong> The 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique is an evidence-based mindfulness exercise that helps you reconnect with your senses and the present moment. It involves identifying:
            <ul>
                <li>5 things you can see</li>
                <li>4 things you can touch</li>
                <li>3 things you can hear</li>
                <li>2 things you can smell</li>
                <li>1 thing you can taste</li>
            </ul>
            This technique is widely used by therapists and mental health professionals to help manage anxiety, stress, and panic attacks.

        <div class="faq-question">Q: Do I need an internet connection to use the app?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">

        <div class="faq-question">Q: Can I save my progress or sessions?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>A:</strong> The app is designed to be used fresh each time, focusing on the present moment. We don't save session data to keep the experience simple and privacy-focused. Each time you use the app, you start a new grounding exercise.

        <div class="faq-question">Q: How do I control the background music?</div>

        <div class="faq-question">Q: What if I can't find items for a particular sense?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>A:</strong> That's okay! The app provides helpful suggestions, but you can also identify items on your own. If you're having trouble with a particular sense (like smell or taste), you can tap "I found all items, let's continue" to proceed. The important thing is to engage with your senses and stay present.

            <strong>A:</strong> No. While 54321 Breath is a helpful tool for managing stress and anxiety, it is not a replacement for professional mental health care. If you're experiencing severe anxiety, depression, or other mental health concerns, please consult with a qualified healthcare provider or therapist.
