    <p>At 54321 Breath, we take your privacy seriously. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.</strong></p>
    <p>54321 Breath is designed with privacy in mind. The app operates entirely on your device and does not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collect any personal information</li>
        <li>Track your usage or behavior</li>
        <li>Store data on external servers</li>
        <li>Share information with third parties</li>
        <li>Use analytics or tracking services</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The app only stores minimal local preferences on your device, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Whether you've completed the onboarding tutorial (stored locally using iOS UserDefaults)</li>
        <li>Your audio preferences (mute/unmute state)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.</p>
    
    <h2>No User Accounts</h2>
    <p>54321 Breath does not require you to create an account or provide any personal information. You can use the app immediately after installation without any registration.</p>
    
    <h2>No Internet Connection Required</h2>
    <p>The app works completely offline. All functionality, including background music and sound effects, is available without an internet connection. This means no data is transmitted over the network.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>54321 Breath does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. Your privacy is fully protected.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is suitable for users of all ages. Since we do not collect any data, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. The app can be safely used by anyone without privacy concerns.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we make any changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Since we don't collect contact information, we cannot notify you directly of changes, but we encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
